A modern Todo application built with React.  
This project was created as part of my **frontend portfolio** to demonstrate practical React skills for junior frontend roles.

## 💼 Why This Project

This project shows that I can:
- Build React applications from scratch
- Manage state with `useReducer`
- Use `React Router` for navigation, URL-based filtering, and a custom 404 page
- Implement protected routes with authentication context
- Write clean, readable, and structured code
- Build simple and user-friendly interfaces

## 🎨 Design Decisions

The UI is intentionally minimal and clean to keep the focus on usability and readability.

- **CSS Modules** were chosen to ensure style isolation and avoid global CSS conflicts  
- Layout is based on simple flex and grid patterns for clarity and responsiveness  
- Consistent spacing, typography, and button styles are shared across pages  
- The interface prioritizes accessibility and ease of use over visual complexity  
- Mobile adaptation was considered from the start to support smaller screens  

The goal was to demonstrate practical, maintainable styling rather than heavy visual effects.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

With more time, the following features could be added:

- Drag & drop support for reordering todos
- Advanced filters (priority, due date)
- Unit and integration tests (Jest / React Testing Library)
- Dark mode toggle
