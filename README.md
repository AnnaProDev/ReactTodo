A modern Todo application built with React.  
This project was created as part of my **frontend portfolio** to demonstrate practical React skills for junior frontend roles.

## 💼 Why This Project

This project shows that I can:
- Build React applications from scratch
- Manage state with `useReducer`
- Use `React Router` for navigation, URL-based filtering, and a custom 404 page
- Implement protected routes with authentication context
- Write clean, readable, and structured code
- Build simple and user-friendly interfaces
